\enclosure{Resumé}
\makelettertitle

I saw your advertisement for the position of a senior PHP developer at
GiggedIn and would like to offer my expertise.

My PR has been granted two months ago and moved to Sydney recently
and looking for a good opportunity like this to work on a startup.

I'm a hacker and love hacking around interesting problems and
enjoy developing applications that somehow are unique. Never give up on
learning cutting edge technologies and improving my programming skills.
I'm a good thinker and always think ahead when I design applications.

I have seven years experience with PHP, at least three years with Bash
scripting and one year with Go, really like PHP because you can develop
so fast that sometimes is unbelievable, really like Go specially because
of it's marvelous features: interfaces, duck-typing, channels and concurrency.

I know design patters (MVC, Factory, Driver, Singelton, Adapter,
Observer and ...).

I know about different kind of web application security attacks and how
to prevent these attacks such as session fixation, XSS, session
hijacking, SQL or code injections and so on also have experience with high
traffic web applications and know how to tune GNU/Linux, Apache or nginx
and design fast web applications.

I only use RDMSes when they fit, and instead fond of using NoSQL/Key-Value
storages when RDMSes are not suitable, have a good knowledge of web standards
and respect those standards and always use handy tools to improve performance
of web applications (Xdebug and Kchachegrind to profile PHP applications,
pprof to profile Go applications)

I like metrics and know about graphit and OpenTSDB and understand
how valuable they could be for startups.

My hacking environment is Debian GNU/linux, vim, tmux, git, lxc, urxvt
and xmonad.

Although I'm a hacker but my former employers see myself also as a
good System Administrator before they consider a full-time sys-admins.

Please feel free to call me at 0431752057 or send me an email at armen@vardump.org
if you need any further information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
